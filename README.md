🤖 AI Research Assistant: A Multi-Agent SystemThis project is a fully functional AI Research Assistant built using a multi-agent system architecture. It automates the process of researching a topic and generating a comprehensive, well-structured report.📝 Problem StatementIn today's fast-paced world, professionals, students, and researchers spend countless hours gathering, summarizing, and synthesizing information to produce reports. This manual process is time-consuming and can be prone to bias. This project aims to solve that problem by deploying a team of specialized AI agents that collaborate to perform research tasks efficiently and produce high-quality, objective reports on any given topic.🧠 How It Works: The Agent InteractionsThe system uses a sequential workflow where the output of one agent becomes the input for the next. This creates an assembly line for knowledge creation.User Input: The process starts when the user provides a research topic.🔍 Searcher Agent:Role: Senior Research AnalystGoal: To find the most relevant and up-to-date articles, data, and news on the internet related to the user's topic.Tool: Tavily Search API.✍️ Summarizer Agent:Role: Expert Content SummarizerGoal: To read all the raw data from the Searcher and distill it into a concise, easy-to-understand summary, highlighting the key points.🧐 Critic Agent:Role: Critical AnalystGoal: To review the summary for any factual inaccuracies, logical fallacies, or potential biases. It provides constructive feedback to ensure the information is balanced and trustworthy.📄 Report Generator Agent:Role: Professional Report WriterGoal: To take the verified summary and the critic's feedback and write a final, polished, and comprehensive research report. The report is structured with an introduction, main body, and conclusion.The final report is then displayed to the user.🛠️ Technologies UsedCore Logic: PythonAI Framework: LangChainLarge Language Model (LLM): Groq (using Llama 3.1) for fast and powerful text generation.Search Tool: Tavily Search API for real-time web access.Web Interface: Streamlit🚀 Setup and Run InstructionsFollow these steps to run the project on your local machine.1.
